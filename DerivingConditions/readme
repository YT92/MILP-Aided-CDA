This folder contains 3 files.
1. The file 'Deriva conditions for Trivium.txt' is the source code which used to obtain the conditions to control propagation of chosen 
   differnces.
   
2. The file 'conditions for I_1(0,3,...,69).txt' is the concrete set of conditions derived to control the each difference d_i for i in I_1, 
   where I_1={0,3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24,27,30,33,36,39,42,45,48,51,54,57,60,63,66,69}.
   
3. The file 'conditions for I_2(1,4,...,70).txt' is the concrete set of conditions derived to control the each difference d_i for i in I_2, 
   where I_2={1,4,7,10,13,16,19,22,25,28,31,34,37,40,43,46,49,52,55,58,61,64,67,70}.
