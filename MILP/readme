This folder consists of 4 files.
1. The file 'figure out the minimum number of 1s.cs' is used to figure out the minimum number of conditions which are equal to 1.
2. The file 'Obtain the maximum space of weak keys.cs' is used to obtain the maximum space of the weak keys after the parameter B 
   is set according to the minimum number of 1s.
3. The file 'ConSet.txt' is the derived conditions to control the propagation of the chosen differences.
   -- The current contains of 'ConSet.txt' are the conditions derived form each v_i for i in I_1, where
   I_1={0,3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24,27,30,33,36,39,42,45,48,51,54,57,60,63,66,69}.
4. The file 'FinalCons.txt' is the output after solving our MILP models. According to it, we could obtain the final conditions imposed on
   key/iv variables.
   -- The current file 'FinalCons.txt' is the output under the condition that parameter B is set to 3. 
      (corresponding condition set is 'ConSet.txt')
